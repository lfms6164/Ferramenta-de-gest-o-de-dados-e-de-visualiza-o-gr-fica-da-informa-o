The idea behind this project is that visual communication is the most efficient way of data communication regardless of its complexity.
It consists of a Form developed using XAML for the GUI and C# for the backend, here the user will input data, this data will then be stored in XML format, then converted to GeoJSON objects so that Leaflet can handle them and present them as interactive layers on the map of Portugal which was developed using JavaScript library, Leaflet.
