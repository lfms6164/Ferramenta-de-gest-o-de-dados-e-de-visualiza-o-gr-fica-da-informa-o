This project was developed by me and the idea behind it is that visual communication is the most efficient way of data communication regardless of its complexity.
It consists of a Form developed in C# using .NET Framework, here the user will input data, this data will then be stored in XML format, then convert them to GeoJSON objects so that Leaflet can handle them and finally present them in the way of an interactive map of Portugal.
